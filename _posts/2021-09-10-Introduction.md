## Definition
### Tiny Home
Home is a very functional building. The evolution of housing is always improving towards practicality and Home is changing accordingly to human needs. Each family has different needs for their own home, and it is very difficult to make a model home fit all customers. So I think the most basic thing about home is to meet the basic needs of people. For example, the function of bedroom, kitchen and toilet is essential. With this requirement, home can be transformed into a patterned and copy-and-paste thing. This is cost saving and convenient. The future of homes that people are now looking for is a model building that can meet the needs of more people. This kind of housing can solve more problems, such as the use of anti-mosquito materials.
Also, I think home has to have a connection with its environment. The landscape has always been difficult to be integrated into architecture. In the relationship between nature and architecture, I think architecture has to actively connect with nature. And home, as the building most closely related to human beings, needs to have a better connection with the landscape.
I wanted the Tiny Home to be small in size, but to meet the needs of different people and to save the owners money. The house can also bring the view of the outside world into the house, creating a new type of tiny homes in the future world.
